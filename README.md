## Screenshots

Below are some screenshots that provide a visual overview of the project:

### Main Interface

![Main Interface](images/dark-mode.png)
_The main screen that defaults in dark mode. Here you can interact with all the different features._

### Feature 1: Warm Colour

![Feature 1](images/warm-colour.png)
_This feature is essentially a preset of "warm" hex values. This is implemented by a few lines of code that randomises the hex value in a given array._

### Feature 2: Random Colour

![Feature 2](images/random.png)
_This feature randomizes the hex value. This code was difficult to implement, so I used stack overflow for help._

### Feature 3: Pencil

![Feature 3](images/pencil-mode.png)
_This pencil feature changes the opacity of the square from light to dark. Due to the opacity changing, this feature doesn't show in dark mode. I will need to come back to this._
